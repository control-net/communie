## SignalR tutorial (Communie)

Real-time SignalR-based chat application example.

âš  This application serves only as a demonstration and shouldn't be used on its own.

### Can I help make this a "real" chat application?

Sure, if you have time and passion, feel free to:

- Create issues for features you would like to see
- Create Pull Requests to implement suggested features
- Translate the documentation
- Create design UX/UI
- _Anything else you can think of..._

### What's up with that name?

Since this has the potential to become a community project, the name pays homage to our last project [Miunie](https://github.com/control-net/miunie) the Discord bot.
